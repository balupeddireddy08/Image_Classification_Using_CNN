# Problem Statement: Image Classification using CNN

### Background:
You are working on a computer vision project to develop an image classification system that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The dataset consists of a large number of labeled images of cats and dogs. Your task is to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify new, unseen images into the correct categories: "Cat" or "Dog."

### Dataset:
The dataset contains thousands of images of cats and dogs, with each image labeled as either "Cat" or "Dog." The images have variations in terms of backgrounds, poses, and appearances.

### Objective:
Build a CNN model to classify images as either "Cat" or "Dog" with high accuracy. The trained model should be capable of generalizing well to new images it hasn't seen during training.
